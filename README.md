As a tennis referee

I want to manage the score of a set of a tennis match between 2 players

In order to display the current Game (SPRINT 1) & Set score of each player

Rules details:

· The set starts with a score of 0 Game for each player

· Each time a player win a Game (see SPRINT 1), the Set score changes as follow:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 (-> 7)

· If a player reach the Set score of 6 and the other player has a Set score of 4 or lower, the player win the Set

· If a player wins a Game and reach the Set score of 6 and the other player has a Set score of 5, a new Game must be played and the first player who reach the score of 7 wins the match

Rules details2:

· If the 2 players reach the score of 6 Games , the Tie-Break rule is activated

· Each time a player win a point, the score changes as follow:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 (-> 8-> 9-> 10-> …)

· The Tie-Break ends as soon as a player gets a least 7 points and 2 points more than his opponent

· The player who wins the Tie-Break wins the Set and the match
